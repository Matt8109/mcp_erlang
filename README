Program Explanations 
---------------------
helloworld.erl - A simple message passing example in erlang.

messageordering.erl - Shows how erlang programs can force the order of operations by
selecting messages in a specific order.

msg_space(_ets).erl - Two files. The first contains our implementation of a tuple space.
The second contains the same test but using Erlang's built in data structure that was
similar called the Erlang Term Storage.  Both run the same benchmark.

Running Programs
---------------------
To run a program in Erlang, start up the Erlang shell by typing 'erl'

To compile, type c(module_name).  The file name is the module name without the .erl file 
extension. Please note, you NEED the period after the parenthesis!

To run the program type:
module_name:go().

go() is the function name you wish to call. For all of our files we have named the
main method go().
